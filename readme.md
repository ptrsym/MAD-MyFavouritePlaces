# MAD Assignment 2


## Milestone 1

24/05/23 
created coredata and persistence files

25/05/23 
mapped object requirements and design requirements
made the coredata objects and their relationships set some constraints on longitude and latitude
built barebones content, placerow and detail view 
researched utilising managed context within extensions and functions
built new place function
investigated how entity relationships are retrieved from the context
realised I would get a runtime error from intialising an empty collection on first launch so added a conditional to the add new place button

27/05/23
built extensions for coredata setters and getters for validation
fixed detailview flow and implemented forms after some research, struggled with errors placing if/else statements within the form
fixed minor errors in relation to entity relationship name changes
project had broken coredata which wasnt being recognised despite everything being set correctly causing lots of unrecognised type and content errors. had to rebuild the file
project seems broken need to completely rebuild commit history likely to change due to new repository

28/05/23
got project working fixing some layout mistakes
added some styling to detailview layout
encountered issues with content view name updating realised I needed to add an ObservedObject wrapper to my PlaceRowView to fix the problem
